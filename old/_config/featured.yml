    Markus has taken a keen interest in Arquillian and has published multiple tutorials on his blog about how to setup Arquillian and use it with alternate containers, namely GlassFish and WebLogic. He's also translated several "Arquillian guides":/guides into German, giving Arquillian native language support in one of its "largest user communities":http://www.seethestats.com/site/arquillian.org#UniquePageviewsByCountry5.
    
    In 2012, Markus received a "JBoss Community Recognition Award":http://jboss.org/jbcra for his contribution to the Arquillian documentation. By receiving this award, Markus demonstrates that documentation can play a critical leadership role in a community software project.
    
    Markus is not only recognized for his contributions, but for continually pushing the community to improve by sharing in his own words the value, potential and challenges of adopting Arquillian.

    Eddú ("@eddumelendez":http://twitter.com/eddumelendez) has been wearing many hats in software houses he worked for - starting from Software Developer to Technical Lead. Lately he decided to take a break from regular work and focus even more on Open Source Software. How amazing is that!? Eddú is one of the key Arquillian contributors, helping in variety of different modules and sharing his great ideas.

    His first encounter with Arquillian was when he was refactoring web services in one of his projects. He found Arquillian and Tomcat Embedded Container the most effective and confident way. Shortly after that he discovered Docker and Arquillian Cube. Ever since he has helped us improving Cube significantly.

    We're extremely happy and honoured to have him involved in building our testing platform.

    Hantsy Bai ("@hantsy":http://twitter.com/hantsy) is self-employed technology consultant focused on Java EE, Spring and Groovy. He lives in Guangzhou, China.
    
    Hantsy seized the opportunity to contribute to Arquillian by translating many of the guides into Simplified Chinese, including "Getting Started":/guides/getting_started_zh_cn, "Getting Started: Rinse and Repeat":/guides/getting_started_rinse_and_repeat_zh_cn, "Getting Started Faster with Forge":/guides/get_started_faster_with_forge_zh_cn and "Testing Java Persistence":/guides/testing_java_persistence_zh_cn.
    
    In 2012, Hantsy received a "JBoss Community Recognition Award":http://jboss.org/jbcra for his formidable contribution of translations, more than any other individual. His contributions have opened up Arquillian to a whole new world of developers. In addition, his dedication has fueled the translation effort. There are now over two dozen translations of the Arquillian guides distributed across ten languages.

    Jakub Narloch ("@jmnarloch":http://twitter.com/jmnarloch) is a Java and .NET software developer who has successfully completed two Google Summer of Code projects and is defendend computer science thesis at the Warsaw University of Technology.
    
    In 2012, the inaugural year for the JBoss Community as a mentor organization in the Google Summer of Code (GSoC) program, Jakub put forth the most compelling proposal of all the candidates. "Jakub's proposal":http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/proposal/review/google/gsoc2012/jnarloch/22002 would extend the boundaries of Arquillian by adding support for testing Spring applications. He not only achieved his goal, but far exceeded expectations. Only a day after the official start of coding, he released the "first alpha":/blog/2012/05/21/arquillian-extension-spring-1-0-0-Alpha1 of the "Arquillian Spring extension":/modules/spring-extension from prototypes he had created since submitting his proposal. By the end of the summer, he had published the "first beta release":/blog/2012/08/17/arquillian-extension-spring-1-0-0-Beta1 of the extension, which included transaction and client-side test support in addition to the features included in the proposal. He's already well on his way to adding "Guice support":https://community.jboss.org/thread/206473 as well.
    
    Ever since Jakub proposed his GSoC project, he has become an integral member of the Arquillian community. We're exceptionally proud of him and fortunate to have him as a contributor.

    Rafael ("@realpestano":http://twitter.com/realpestano) became an Arquillian advocate early on, publishing multiple blog posts about our testing platform and sharing his testing experience on conferences. The thing which got him attracted to Arquillian is the idea of "testing closer to production" as well as the extensible and plugable architecture.

    His main area of expertise is Java enterprise web related technologies, agile methodologies and testing. He not only helped us to improve many extensions but also advocated Arquillian Testing Platform among his teammates as well as on JUGs and conferences.
