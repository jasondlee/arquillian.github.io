We have released yet another minor version of Arquillian Core. This time with long lasted fix for TestNG test failures reporting.

h3. Support for new TestNG versions

Finally, we have a fix landed in "TestNG":https://github.com/cbeust/testng/issues/1426 and Arquillian Core, supporting newer versions of TestNG. So grab it while it's hot. 

One important note here if you want to rely only on Maven Central repository - TestNG @6.12@ is not in Maven Central and @6.13@ refers to JCommander version which is also not in Maven Central (sic!). You can read about the problem "here":https://github.com/cbeust/testng/issues/1506.

You have two options to mitigate it:

* Use recently published TestNG @6.13.1@ having proper JCommander dependency
* Add version of JCommander which is published to Maven Central before TestNG dependency (e.g. @1.69@ or @1.72@).
