h3. Welcome JUnit Rules for Arquillian

p. Just before Christmas holidays we are extremely excited to ship long awaited feature for JUnit integration. If you want to use Arquillian Testing Platform with other JUnit Runner, you can now use JUnit Rules - @ArquillianTestClass@ and @ArquillianTest@ - and happily let Arquillian do the heavy lifting for your tests. Hats off to "Alexander Schwartz":https://twitter.com/ahus1de for providing initial implementation.

p. To get the similar functionality what the @@RunWith(Arquillian.class)@ is offering you should require both rules i.e. @ArquillianTestClass@ and @ArquillianTest@.

bc(prettify).. @ClassRule
public static ArquillianTestClass arquillianTestClass = new ArquillianTestClass();

@Rule
public ArquillianTest arquillianTest = new ArquillianTest();

@Deployment
public static JavaArchive createDeployment() {
    return ShrinkWrap.create(JavaArchive.class)
        .addClass(Greeter.class)
        .addAsManifestResource(EmptyAsset.INSTANCE, "beans.xml");
}

@Inject
Greeter greeter;

@Test
public void should_greet_earthlings() throws Exception {
    String name = "Earthlings";
    Assert.assertEquals("Hello, " + name, greeter.greet(name));
}

p. In order to use any other JUnit Class or Method Rule with @ArquillianClassTest@ or @ArquillianTest@ rule, you have to use it with @RuleChain@ having arquillian rules defined as outer rules.. e.g.
  
bc(prettify).. @Rule
public MethodRule testWatchman = MethodRuleChain.outer(new ArquillianTest().around(new TestWatchman());

p. There is no chain for method rules "out of the box provided by JUnit":https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/issues/383#issuecomment-5056440 so we have our own and you can use it if you need.

p. If you would like to see it in action, take a look at following examples

* "Using Arquillian JUnit rule with Cube":https://github.com/arquillian/arquillian-cube/pull/913/files
* "Using Arquillian JUnit rules with Graphene":https://github.com/arquillian/arquillian-graphene/pull/176/files
