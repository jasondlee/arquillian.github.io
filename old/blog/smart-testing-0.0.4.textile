h3. Highlights of this release

p. In this release we shipped two key new features - support for JUnit 5 and declarative way of defining relations between tests and business code. And bunch of fixes.

h3. Annotations for affected tests

p. Starting from this release you are able to use declarative way of defining relationship between test and business code. By default affected strategy uses imports declared in the tests to build the graph of collaborators. This approach is fine for unit tests (white box tests) but might not work for higher level tests (black box test).

p. Using annotation like below you can define classes or packages which particular test covers. 

bc(prettify).. @ComponentUnderTest(packages = "org.acme.main.superbiz.*")
public class AcmeServiceRestTest { ... }

p. Check our detailed "documentation":http://arquillian.org/smart-testing/#_explicitly_set on how to use it.

h3. What's next

We continue improving the tool so watch out for more!
