This release is (hopefully) the last step before the final release of the second generation of the Arquillian Drone extension.


h3. Significant changes and additions

<i class="icon-star"></i> Support for Drone webdriver injection in @@BeforeClass@

<i class="icon-star"></i> Drones with a deployment scoped life cycle are now more tightly connected to the deployment - it's creation has been postponed to the @@AfterDeploy@ phase

- <i class="icon-star"></i> Some SPI event have been merged/replaced :=

The following events:

* BeforeDroneCallableCreated
* AfterDroneConfigured
* BeforeDroneConfigured
* AfterDroneCallableCreated

are now merged into:

* BeforeDronePrepared
* AfterDronePrepared

p. They are called before/after both the Drone configuration and the Drone callable instance are prepared. This ensures that both or none of the objects should be present.
