h3. Arquillian Governor Ignore

This extension simply ignores (skips) test methods which are listed in @arquillian.xml@.

Configuration of this extension is done via @governor-ignore@ qualifier:

bc(prettify).. <extension qualifier="governor-ignore">
    <property name="expression">com\.foobar\.[.]*</property>
    <property name="methods">org.acme.foo.ListTest#testStrFilter,org.bar.boo.QwertTest#testFoo</property>
    <property name="methods_1">org.arquillian.test.governor.ignore.IgnoreTest#testIgnored</property>
</extension>

p. The @expression@ property is a regexp to which it matches simple method’s fqn.

The @methods@ property contains a list of simple fqn’s, separated by comma (,), where any property starting with @methods_@ is a separate simple fqn.

Of course all properties are optional. But in order to ignore something, at least one must be defined. ;-)
