h3. Significant changes and additions:

<i class="icon-star"></i> Upgraded Selenium to 3.5.3

<i class="icon-star"></i> Added ability to explicitly specify the target architecture of the IE web-driver binary. To do it, use the property @ieDriverArch@ with any of the two possible values: @Win32@ and @x64@. If the property is not specified then the architecture is resolved from the host OS. Big thanks to "Václav Muzikář":https://github.com/vmuzikar/ for implementing it.
