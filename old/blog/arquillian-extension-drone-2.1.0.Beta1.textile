In this first Beta release, we finally finished the automatic download feature of all binaries used in Drone. The reason is that the automatic download is now implemented also for PhantomJS binary which was the last one that hadn't been covered.

h3. Properties, directory names and support of latest versions

* Property that intended to be used as a system property to define a path to a binary:
@phantomjs.binary.path@

* Property that is intended to be used as a property used in arquillian.xml file to define a path to a binary:
@phantomjsBinary@

* Is the resolution of the latest version supported?  (if the latest version is resolved when no property is defined):
*YES*

* Arquillian.xml property to define version of the binary that should be downloaded/used:
@phantomjsBinaryVersion@

* Arquillian.xml property to define an URL the binary should be downloaded from:
@phantomjsBinaryUrl@

* Name of the sub-directory (withing @$HOME/.arquillian/drone/@) the binaries are cached in:
@phantomjs@
