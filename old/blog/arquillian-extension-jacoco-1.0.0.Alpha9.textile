h3(highlights). Highlights in this release

<i class="icon-star"></i> Filtering improvements

p. We have fixed and extended filtering capabilities in JaCoCo extension. If you don't specify any @includes@ nor @excludes@ JaCoCo will try to instrument every single class it can find on the classpath. This is not only time consuming but might lead to some issues.

p. At the end of the day most of the times you are not interested in coverage for external libraries. With simple configuration like the one below you can control classes and packages.

    <property name="includes">my.package.some.include.*,fully.qualified.class.name.MyClass</property>
  </extension>
        
</arquillian>

p. In case of conflicting patterns in @excludes@ and @includes@, @excludes@ always wins.
