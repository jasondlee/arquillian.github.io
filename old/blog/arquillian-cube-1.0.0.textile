p. Finally we stopped long lasting series of Alpha releases and we are proud of bringing version of Arquillian Cube 1.0.0 to you. Obviously Alpha versions where totally usable but now we feel confident that internal API is mature and stable. It's unlikely new versions will cause backward compatibilty issues.

p. We have also started using "Semantic Versioning":http://semver.org/ in Arquillian Cube. For this reason there is no @Arquillian Cube 1.0.0.Final@ but simply @Arquillian Cube 1.0.0@.

h3. What's new

p. <i class="icon-star"></i> **OpenShift Client Resource Provider**

p. OpenShift test can be enriched with @OpenShiftClient@ instance.

bc(prettify).. public class HelloWorldTest {

    @ArquillianResource
    OpenShiftClient client;

}
