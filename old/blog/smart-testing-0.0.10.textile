h3. Excluded categories specification

p. Smart Testing is now supporting the exclusion of test categories.

p. In this release we introduced the @excludedCategories@ parameter for the @categorized@ strategy. 
   When using this parameter, you specify the test categories you want to skip from execution,
    as you would in the @excludedGroups@ parameter of the @maven-surefire-plugin@.

p. The @excludedCategories@ works well with both **JUnit 4** and **JUnit 5** categories system (e.g the **@Category** and **@Tag** annotations) 

p. This release also removes the @matchAll@ and @reversed@ parameters from the @categorized@ strategy, as the behaviour is replaced with the @excludedCategories@ parameters.
