p. New version of Arquillian Cube 1.4.0 has been released with new features and bug fixes.

h3. What's new

p. <i class="icon-star"></i> **Allow star operator in Container Object DSL**

p. Now you can use star operator to generate random container names nad binding ports in Container Object DSL too.

bc(prettify).. @ClassRule
public static ContainerDslRule redisStar = new ContainerDslRule("redis:3.2.6", "redis*")
                                            .withPortBinding(6379);

p. In previous example a container with random name starting with @redis@ is started and a random binding port is used. Notice that this allows parallel execution of tests against same docker host. You can read more about star operator at "Parallel Execution":http://arquillian.org/arquillian-cube/#_parallel_execution for more information about it.

p. <i class="icon-star"></i> **Uses latest version of wait-for-it algorithm**

p. Copied "latest":https://github.com/vishnubob/wait-for-it/commit/8f52a814ef0cc70820b87fbf888273f3aa7f5a9b @wait-for-it.sh@ script into Arquillian Cube.
