p. New version of Arquillian Cube 1.0.0.Alpha20 has been released with one handy new feature and few bug fixes.

h3. What's new

p. <i class="icon-star"></i> **Arquillian Cube Container Object DSL**

p. A new option to start/stop containers is based on a generic container object provided by Arquillian Cube to define cube instances.

bc(prettify).. @DockerContainer
Container pingpong = Container.withContainerName("pingpong")
                        .fromImage("jonmorehouse/ping-pong")
                        .withPortBinding(8080)
                        .build();

@Test
public void should_return_ok_as_pong() throws IOException {
   String response = ping(pingpong.getIpAddress(), pingpong.getBindPort(8080));
  assertThat(response).containsSequence("OK");
}

p. You can also create networks in a similar, programmatic way:

bc(prettify).. @DockerNetwork
Network network = Network.withDefaultDriver("mynetwork").build();

p. By default Arquillian Cube will start and stop containers/networks at before/after test class execution, not per test method. You can modify this by using @.withConnectionMode@ and configure it to be per test method.

p. Last but not least thank you to all users that has reported issues.
