Apart from several fixes this release brings two improvements:


h4. <i class="icon-star"></i> Property for skipping creation of @Drone instances

We introduced a system property @arquillian.drone.skip.creation@. If you set the property to @true@ then Drone skips the creation/injection of *@Drone* instances. This property is checked in a *@Before* phase, so you can modify the property during the test execution.


h4. <i class="icon-star"></i>  ChromeHeadless browser property

Since Chrome 59 it is possible to use headless mode. To do it in Drone, it was necessary to set @chromeArguments@ to @--headless@:

bc(prettify).. <property name="browser">chrome</property>
<property name="chromeArguments">--headless</property>


p. This release simplifies the process by introducing a new browser property value: @chromeHeadless@. If you use the value as a browser property:

bc(prettify).. <property name="browser">chromeHeadless</property>

p. the arguments are automatically set, so the browser will be launched in the headless mode.
