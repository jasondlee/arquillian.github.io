h3. Authenticated GitHub requests

In case of "downloading webdrivers":http://arquillian.org/arquillian-extension-drone/#_automatic_download from GitHub, you may reach the "rate limit":https://developer.github.com/v3/#rate-limiting for unauthenticated requests (60 per hour). To avoid this, there had been implemented several caching mechanisms, but in some cases (larger CI matrix jobs) it doesn't have to suffice.

Because of these problems, in this release, we have introduced support for authenticated GitHub requests. In the case of authenticated connections the rate limit is much higher, so it should be almost impossible to reach the limit. To use it you need to specify your GitHub username and secret token in your @arquillian.xml@ file:

bc(prettify).. <property name="githubUsername">${github.username}</property>
<property name="githubToken">${github.secretToken}</property>

p(info). %You can imagine that exposing your secrets in the arquillian.xml file is not the best idea. Instead of it, we are suggesting using variables (as you can see in the example) and then specify the secrets on command line (or in your system properties):
@mvn test -Dgithub.username=john -Dgithub.secretToken=doe_password@%
