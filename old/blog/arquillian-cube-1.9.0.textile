p. New version of Arquillian Cube 1.9.0 has been released with new features and bug fixes.

h3. What's new

p. <i class="icon-star"></i> **Add support for network aliases**

p. Add support for network aliases in @docker compose@ format "docker-compose aliases":https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/#aliases.

p. <i class="icon-star"></i> **Disable OpenShift ImageStream detection by default**

p. New flag has been added to enable/disable the detection of OpenShift Image Streams. These files must be located at @target@ directory and their names should end with @-is.yml@.

p. By default this detection is disabled hence these files are not processed. If you want to enable you need to set OpenShift configuration parameter @enableImageStreamDetection@ to true.

p. You can read more about this parameter at "Arquillian Cube documentation":http://arquillian.org/arquillian-cube/#_openshift_configuration_parameters

p. Many thanks to "Georg Wolf":https://github.com/georgwolf, "Jens":https://github.com/jensstn and "Ladislav Thon":https://github.com/Ladicek for their help.
