This release contains a very important fix for the "automatic download":http://arquillian.org/arquillian-extension-drone/#_automatic_download feature - for cases when the geckodriver (firefox) is used.
GitHub provides a limited set of unauthorized requests (which is the way we get information about releases), and there were some corner-cases when it was quite easy to reach the limit.
This release provides improvements/fixes that should avoid such an exceedance also in these cases.
