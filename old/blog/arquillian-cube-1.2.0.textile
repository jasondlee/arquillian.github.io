p. New version of Arquillian Cube 1.2.0 has been released with new features and few bug fixes.

h3. What's new

p. <i class="icon-star"></i> **Adds annotation for sleeping before each test**

p. You can annotate a class with @@Sleep@ annotation so before starting executing the tests, the execution is slept by the amount of milliseconds set there.

p. This annotation also supports timespan format. For example @@Sleep("1m30s")@ set a waiting of 1 minute and a half.

p. <i class="icon-star"></i> **Add support for @@HealthCheck annotation@**

p. p. You can annotate a class with @@HealthCheck@ annotation so before starting executing the tests, the execution is slept until the health check passes.

p. For example @@HealthCheck("/myservice/healthcheck")@ waits until the given endpoint returns an Http Code 200.

p. <i class="icon-star"></i> **JUnit Rule for Container Object DSL approach**

p. Now you can use Container Object DSL without @Arquillian@ runner. You only need to use a @JUnit Rule@ for this purpose.

bc(prettify)..  @ClassRule
 public static ContainerDslRule redis = new ContainerDslRule("redis:3.2.6")
                                            .withPortBinding(6379);

p. Before executing test class, a new Docker container using Redis image is boot up and stopped after all tests.

p. Many thanks to "A. Bos":https://github.com/adhesivee for his help.
