p. This release of Arquillian Cube Q contains one new, but important feature - ability to add randomness on selected toxics values using mathematical distributions. Currently "uniform distribution":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_distribution_(continuous) and "log-normal distribution":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log-normal_distribution are supported.

<i class="icon-star"></i> Example using Log Normal distribution

bc(prettify).. networkChaos.on("pingpong", 8080)
    .latency(logNormalLatencyInMillis(2000, 0.3))
    .exec(times(2), () -> {
        URL url = new URL("http://" + ip + ":" + 8081 + "/hw/HelloWorld");
        String response = IOUtil.asString(url.openStream());
    });


p. In the example above, latency times are distributed in using a log-normal distribution with median of 2 seconds and 0.3 as sigma value. Then for each iteration of the test, a new value is calculated and send to toxiproxy.
