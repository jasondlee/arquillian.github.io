h3(highlights). Some of the highlights in this release

h4. Ability to define wait time before connecting to the container

p. In some cases you might want to define wait time before trying to connect to the GlassFish container. For this purpose we have introduce simple configuration. Thanks  "Ankur Kathuria":https://github.com/ankathur for helping out.

div(filename). arquillian.xml

bc(prettify)..  <container qualifier="glassfish" default="true">
  <configuration>
    <property name="waitTimeMs">200</property>
    <property name="retries">5</property>
  </configuration>
</container>

p. 
  * @waitTimeMs@ defines how many miliseconds Arquillian will wait before trying to connect to the container
  * @retries@ defines how many attempts should be made with @waitTimeMs@ intervals

h4. Minor bug fixes

Thanks to  "Mirko Lelansky":https://github.com/mirko-lelansky we have improved usage of GlassFish CLI.
