Big day! After several rounds of hardening through Candidate releases we have reached final version of GlassFish container adapter, which works with both older GlassFish versions as well as Payara.

h3. Some of the highlights in this release

* **Support for Payara 4.1.x containers**
  With this release, we enhanced our tests to cover Payara containers as a part of the test suite.

* **Ability to control startup of the Derby database**
  By simply adding @startDerby@ property to your @arquillian.xml@ you start embedded database for your tests running against managed container.

* **Adds @https@ ports binding configuration for embedded container**
  Simply define @bindHttpsPort@ in your @arquillian.xml@ and you are ready to go.
