We're happy to announce fourth release of the Arquillian Byteman.

Byteman is a tool which simplifies tracing and testing of Java programs. Byteman allows you to insert extra Java code into your application, either as it is loaded during JVM startup or even after it has already started running. The injected code is allowed to access any of your data and call any application methods, including where they are private. You can inject code almost anywhere you want and there is no need to prepare the original source code in advance nor do you have to recompile, repackage or redeploy your application. In fact you can remove injected code and reinstall different code while the application continues to execute.

When testing your application you can use Byteman to inject faults or synchronization code, causing your application to perform unusual or unexpected operations required to exercise a test scenario. 

In this release we brought several improvements:

* Updated extension to use latest version of Byteman as well as Arquillian Core.
* Fixed an issue with @Submit@ command when agent is already running.
* Improved test suite using "Arquillian Chameleon":https://github.com/arquillian/arquillian-container-chameleon to test it against several different containers (such as different "WildFly":http://wildfly.org versions).

p. See the "Byteman Website":http://byteman.jboss.org/ for more on how to write rules.
