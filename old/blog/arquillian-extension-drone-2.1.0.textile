The final release of Drone 2.1.0 is here!
As a part of this release, apart from several bug fixes, we bring you two significant changes:

h4. Browser configuration is not case sensitive anymore

Now, it doesn't matter if you use @htmlUnit@ or @htmlunit@. For both cases, you get the same browser. This is applied for all browsers that are supported by Drone.

h4. Support for configuration of WebClient options in HtmlUnitDriver

If you want to configure WebClient options in HtmlUnitDriver, then use the arquillian.xml property: @htmlUnitWebClientOptions@
The value of this property should be a semicolon separated list of webClientOptions. e.g.

bc(prettify).. <property name="htmlUnitWebClientOptions">
   timeout=10; throwExceptionOnScriptError=false; SSLClientProtocols=protocal1, protocal2
</property>
