In the final release of ShrinkWrap Resolver 3.0.0, we are introducing you one new feature into the EmbeddedMaven logic.

h2. Maven build invocation command & Logging

In the previous releases, there was no easy way to get the DEBUG log from the Maven Invoker tool, including the command that is used for Maven build invocation.
In this release, we are introducing a method @setDebugLoggerLevel()@ that sets the threshold of the InvokerLogger to DEBUG level. An example of the usage is:

bc(prettify).. EmbeddedMaven.forProject("path/to/pom.xml").setDebugLoggerLevel()

p. When it is set, then in the very beginning of the debug log, there is also contained the command that is used for the Maven build invocation. That will help you with debugging your potential problematic Maven builds.


Apart from this feature, you can find also several improvements, component upgrades and a lot of bug fixes there. For more information, check the release notes and resolved issues listed at the end of this announcement.
