p. New version of Arquillian Universe 1.1.12.0 has been released!

h3. What's new

p. <i class="icon-star"></i> **Version convention**

p. A new version strategy has been defined for Arquillian Universe. Instead of having _alpha_ versions incrementing the number of alpha, new strategy will have following scheme:

p. With @Arquillian Core 1.1.12@ released and no new extensions included in universe yet, the version for universe would be @1.1.12.0@. When, let's say we have new @Cube-Q@ version but the **core** is still untouched we bump last digit and release @1.1.12.1@.

p. In essence the first three parts of the version corresponds to Arquillian Core that is compatible with current universe. The last section is an increment of universe still being compatible with core but with new/updated extensions.

p. <i class="icon-star"></i> **Arquillian Cube Kubernetes**

p. With this release we added Arquillian Cube Kubernetes support.
