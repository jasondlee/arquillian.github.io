h3. Test method selection

p. In all previous versions of the Smart Testing tool, by using the @selecting@ mode, it was possible to select the whole test classes only.

p. In this release, we have introduced a possibility of selecting on the test method level. This new feature can be applied with two strategies: @failed@ and @categorized@.
In case of the @failed@ strategy - if you have a class with 10 test methods and only one of them fails, then in the next build Smart Testing selects and executes only the one test method that failed instead of running the whole test class. This should minimize the test suite execution and make the feedback loop much faster.
In case of the @categorized@ strategy, it means that Smart Testing now resolves the annotations specified on the test methods and is able to select only test methods that belong to required categories.
By default, it is enabled for both strategies, but you can disable it either in the configuration file or using system properties @-Dsmart.testing.failed.methods=false@ or @-Dsmart.testing.categorized.methods=false@ respectively.

p(info). %Test method selection can be used only with the @selecting@ mode.%

h3. What's next

In the next release, we are going to provide you a support for excluding categories in the @categorized@ strategy.  Stay tuned!
