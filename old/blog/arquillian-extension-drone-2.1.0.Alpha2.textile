The second Alpha release of Drone 2.1.0 brings:

* Support for Edge browser
* Support for Selenium Server arguments
* Component upgrades
* Bug fixes

h2. Edge

After a long time, the Microsoft Edge Web Browser is supported by Drone. Big thanks to "Tomas David":https://github.com/tomasdavidorg/ as he is the hero who implemented and tested this feature.

To use Edge in you UI tests specify @edge@ as a @browser@ property in your arquillian.xml file:

pre. <property name="browser">edge</property>

In case of Edge, Drone provides also the automatic download feature - for more information see "Drone documentation":http://arquillian.org/arquillian-extension-drone/#_automatic_download


h2. Selenium Server command line arguments

In the last release announcement, we mentioned that the Selenium Server is automatically started when necessary. It wasn't possible to specify any argument (except for port) that should be used when an instance is started.

In this release, we introduce parameter @seleniumServerArgs@ which you can define in your arquillian.xml file to specify arguments that should be used.

For example, if you used these properties:

pre. <property name="seleniumServerArgs">-debug true -role node -browserTimeout 1000</property>
<property name="browser">firefox</property>


then the command used for starting Selenium Server instance would look like:

pre. java -Dwebdriver.gecko.driver=target/.../geckodriver
     -jar target/.../selenium-server-standalone-3.3.1.jar
     -port 4444 -debug true -role node -browserTimeout 1000

We hope that you'll enjoy our new stuff and look forward to hearing your feedback.
